# SOM for IDS
This project is part of a university project for UniRoma3, aimed at evaluating Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), especially using the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of SOMs in clustering and identifying patterns in network intrusion data.

This project utilizes the MiniSom library to implement Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for data analysis and visualization. MiniSom is an open-source Python library developed by __@JustGlowing__, and you can find the library repository [here](https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom).

## Dataset
